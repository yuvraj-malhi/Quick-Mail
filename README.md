# Quick Mail

## Description
The task of sending emails is often boring and **_time consuming_**. Opening the browser, opening email, logging in, composing and then sending. By chance if you have a slow internet, then it will take forever!

On these lines (as we fo with every other problem), this programs is a solution to make this task much **simpler**, **faster**, and **easily scalable**.

The program sends mails from any linux distro having a cURL library, thus making it a very general purpose and reliable method of sending quick mails. The user interface has been made very functional yet simple. Simplicity is key. 

Before you proceed, a one time setup has to be done for every new sender. So do this for every new email ID you want to use to send emails via Quick Mail.
